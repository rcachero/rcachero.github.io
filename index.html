        <p>Back in 2003, I was really into computer games, such as Command&Conquer and Starcraft. The enjoyment of computer gaming brought forth my love for computer technology and self-learning. I successfully built my first computer in 2005 and graduated with a Electrical Engineering degree at UC Irvine in 2008.</p>
        <p>I am currently a Software QA Engineer for Teradek in Irvine, CA. This role sparked my interest in software programming and web development. I decided to teach myself to code and made it my 2015 New Year's Resolution. I followed sites such as TheOdinProject and FreeCodeCamp, however I personally like FreeCodeCamp because it chooses to focus on one language, Javascript. I am also using other resources, such as Treehouse and Codeschool, to help motivate me on my coding journey.</p>
